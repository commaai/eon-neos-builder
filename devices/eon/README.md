This build environment is designed and tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and
certain parts of the Android system build still use legacy Python 2 code.
Make sure the system default Python 2 has not been replaced with Python 3,
either directly or using `pyenv` to override. Remove the `pyenv` entries
from your PATH if necessary.

# Build procedure with clean /usr
This process requires an EON connected with [Comma Smays](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-smays-adapter)!
1. Build all images with clean `/usr`: `CLEAN_USR=1 ./build_all.sh`
2. Flash everything to EON: `sudo ./flash.sh`
3. SSH into EON and run `~/install.sh` to finishing building all packages
4. Build new system image with compiled packages. Make sure EON is still connected for this step since it will pull `/usr` from the EON. `CLEAN_USR=1 STAGE2=1 ./build_system.sh`
5. Build OTA images: `./prepare_ota.sh`

# Comma internal only: publishing NEOS images to Azure

1. After building NEOS, run `./ota_push_staging.sh`, this will push the ota to the staging bucket on azure.
2. Copy `neosupdate/update.staging.json` into openpilot `installer/updater/update.json`
3. Update the NEOS version check in `launch_chffrplus.sh`.
4. When going to production run `./ota_push_prod.sh`, and put `neosupdate/update.json` in the updater folder.

# Comma internal only: updating an existing NEOS image with current dashcam-staging

1. Ensure the openpilot repo dashcam-staging branch is up-to-date and has the desired base `installer/updater/update.json`
2. Fetch the current NEOS and re-roll the system partition with the current dashcam version slipstreamed: `./build_dashcam_images.sh`
3. Run `./prepare_ota.sh` to generate new signed OTA update images.
4. Run `./ota_push_prod.sh` to upload to Azure.
5. Replace `update.json` in the eon-neos repository with `neosupdate/update.json`.
